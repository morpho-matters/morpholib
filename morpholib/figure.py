This is the base module of the figures package.
All the classes, functions, constants, etc. found here are imported
into the morpho.figures namespace when
import morpho.figure
is called.

To avoid name conflicts, please avoid using names in the
outermost scope that could be names of subpackages.
This can be done by avoiding names that are nothing but
lowercase letters since convention has it that package

### CLASSES ###


# The superclass of all drawable objects in Morpho.
# All subclasses like Point, Path, etc. derive from this.
# To make a figure subclass, note that the constructor must
# be able to handle a void call like
# foo = mySubFigure()
# because tweening requires this kind of call.
# This doesn't stop you from having optional arguments,
# but all subclasses of Figure must be allowed to call
# the constructor with no inputs.
class Figure(object):
    # Takes a list of tweenables as input.
    # By default, the constructor makes an attribute sharing the name
    # of each tweenable in the list (unless it conflicts with an existing
    # attribute name).

        # lower zdepths.
        # If zdepths match, draw order is inferred from order of figure list.
        # Later figures are drawn in front.
        # zdepth can be int or float, but should be finite.
        # Also note that zdepth only works local to a single layer.

    # BUILT-IN TWEEN METHODS

    # Linear tween method. This linearly tweens pretty much all tweenables
    # that are number-like, including arrays and lists of numbers, but also
    # number to number functions.
    # This tween method can be suppressed for a specific tweenable by including
    # the tag "nolinear" in the tweenable.
    #
    # This tween method expects data that are instances of the following types:
    # float, complex, int, np.ndarray, list, tuple, python function
    #
    # Tweening lists or tuples is generally done by converting into np.array
    # to speed up computation, but this behavior can be suppressed by including
    # the "loop" tag, which will result in a regular python loop to tween the
    # elements of your list/tuple.
    #
    # "ignore" is an optional argument where you can specify a list of
    # tweenable names that should NOT be acted on even though they may qualify
    # to be tweened under tweenLinear(). Mainly used when other tween
    # methods invoke tweenLinear() in order to avoid unnecessarily tweening
    # an attribute that is otherwise handled.
    # NOTE: This optional argument is a COURTESY, and is only required to be
    # supported by the generic tween methods found in this class.
    # (e.g. tweenLinear, tweenSpiral, tweenPivot)
    # Derivative tween methods may (or may not) support this option.
    # Thus, you should be wary of using super().tweenLinear(other, t, ignore=foo)
    # unless you are sure every superclass's linear tween supports "ignore".
    # Otherwise, to use "ignore", invoke this method directly via
    # morpho.Figure.tweenLinear(self, other, t, ignore=foo)
