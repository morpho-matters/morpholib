# TWEENABLES
# figures = List of figures in the frame. For tweening to work,
#           the figures list of both Frames must have corresponding
#           figure types. e.g. Frame([point, path]) can only tween with
#           another Frame([point, path]).
# origin = Translation value (complex number). Default: 0.
#
# If the frame consists of subfigures of exactly the same type, the
# subfigure attributes can be set all at once using the "all" syntax:
#   EXAMPLE: myframe.all.pos = 3+4j
# However, in-place operations can't be depended on to work
#   EXAMPLE: myframe.all.pos += 2j   # Doesn't dependably work
# This can be used to access subfigure attributes as well, but will
# throw an error if the value of the accessed subattribute is
# different across different subfigures
#   EXAMPLE: commonPosition = myframe.all.pos
#
# Note that tweening a frame via tween() will tween the frame's
# attributes along with its underlying figure list, but calling
# a frame's tween method directly (via defaultTween) will only tween
# the frame's attributes and NOT the underlying figure list.
#
# Also note that the transition function supplied to a frame will NOT
# propagate down to the figures in the figures list. When tweening a frame,
# the individual transition functions of each figure are used.
# The transition of the Frame figure itself really only applies to its
# own `origin` tweenable.

# Groups actors together and gives them a common camera actor.
# This is used in the Animation class.
#
# ATTRIBUTES
# actors = List of actors that are part of this layer. Default: []
# view/camera = Camera actor associated with this layer. Default: Camera()
#               Note that layer visibility is linked to camera visibility.
#               Whenever the camera is invisible, so will the layer be.
# timeOffset = (DEPRECATED)
#              Number of frames the indices should be offset to line up
#              with the index system used by the Animation class. Basically
#              allows you to setup a local time axis offset from the global
#              Animation time axis. Increasing timeOffset causes the layer to
#              be animated at later points in the Animation.
# visible = Global visibility attribute. If set to False, the layer is never drawn
#           regardless of the state of the camera actor.
# start/end = (DEPRECATED)
#             Specify a time window where the layer will be visible.
#             They are specified relative to the layer's LOCAL time axis.
# mask = Specify another layer object which will serve as the "mask" for this layer.
#        The mask layer basically serves as a window or opening in which the target
#        layer can appear thru. Only the parts of the target layer that overlap with
#        opaque portions of the mask layer will appear.

# Collects layers into a single animation and a unified timeline.
# This class is where the animation can be played or exported.
#
# PRIMARY ATTRIBUTES
# layers = List of layers contained in this animation. Layers late in the list
#          are drawn in front of layers early in the list. Default: []
# windowShape = Tuple specifying window dimensions (width, height) in pixels.
#               Default: (600, 600)
# frameRate = Frames per second (fps). Default: 30
# firstIndex/start = Starting frame of the animation.
#           Default: None (meaning it will use mation.firstID() )
# finalIndex/end = Ending frame of animation.
#           Default: None (meaning it will use mation.lastID() )
# delays = Dict mapping index values to delay duration (in frames).
#          Animation will pause for the specified durations at the given indices.
#          Specifying infinite duration will pause animation indefinitely until
#          screen is clicked.
# background = Background color (RGB list). Default: (0,0,0) (black)
# alpha = Background opacity. Default: 1 (opaque)
# resizable = Boolean indicating whether window can be resized during playback.
#             Default: False
# fullscreen = Boolean indicating whether animation should be played fullscreen.
#              Default: False
# screen = int denoting which monitor to display on (0 is primary monitor).
#          Default: 0
# locaterLayer = Given layer or layer list index, prints the physical coordinates
#                of a mouse click relative to that layer whenever the animation
#                playback is clicked. Default: None
# locaterModifier = Complex to complex function which modifies
#       complex number positions generated from the locater layer.
#       The generated locator layer positions are passed into this
#       function and the return value is printed to the console instead.
#       Default: Identity (do nothing) function z |--> z
# clickTime = Boolean if set to True, prints current frame index to console
#             whenever animation is clicked to pause.
#             Options: "frames", "seconds"
#             Note: This ignores animation delays.
# clickCopy = Boolean if set to True and locaterLayer is set, then every click
#             will copy the complex coordinates of the click to the
#             clipboard.
# clickRound = Boolean if set to int N, the coordinates of a locater layer
#              click round to N decimal places. By default it's set to None,
#              meaning no rounding will take place.
# transition = Global transition function applied to all figures in the animation.
#              Default: morpho.transitions.uniform
# antialiasText = Boolean indicating whether text should be antialiased.
#                 Default: True
